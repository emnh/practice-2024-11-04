    # The first subgoal is to explore all numbers from 1 to k in all possible ways in which it can be done.
    # That's actually just all orderings, so k!, k faculty, implying it grows astronomically.
    # For example, if k is 100 that is already 3 628 800, rounded to 4 million.
    # Ok that's too many possibilities. I'll change the task to writing python functions
    # for ways of structured counting that I can think of, hopefully fun ways :) .
    # We are not interested in different programming language techniques of counting,
    # but rather in the mathematical structures of counting.
    # Each way shall be representend in a separate generator function.
    # The functions shall be tested with the same input, to see if they give the same result, i.e. the numbers from 1 to k, after sorting the output.
    # Each generator function invocation takes a number k and yields the numbers between 1 and k in a certain order.
